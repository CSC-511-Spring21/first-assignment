To start up this project, type in "ember s" in the terminal and you should be good to go.

I put the information for the date as a tracked value in the Javascript file.  I put the onclick event to update the date as an @action in the javascript file as well, and wired these values up to the handlebars file. Unfortunately, I tried doing the extra credit to no avail. I tried setInterval and later but it didn't work, so I'm probably doing it wrong.
